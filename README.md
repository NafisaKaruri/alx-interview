This repository is part of the ALX Software Engineering specialization (backend) program. It contains code for possible technical interview questions.

## Projects
1. [0x00-pascal_triangle](0x00-pascal_triangle/)
  - **Pascal Triange**: This project includes implementation to generate Pascal's Triangle.
2. [0x01-lockboxes](0x01-lockboxes/)
  - **Lockboxes**: This project determines whether all locked boxes can be opened given a list of boxes and their corresponding keys. The `canUnlockAll` function uses a breadth-first search approach to efficiently navigate through the keys.
3. [0x02-minimum_operations](0x02-minimum_operations/)
   - **Minimum Operations**: This project calculates the fewest number of operations needed to achieve exactly `n` H characters in a text file using "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The `minOperations` function efficiently uses dynamic programming and prime factorization to determine the solution.
